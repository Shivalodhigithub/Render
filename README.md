# Crop Recommendation System

## Overview
The **Crop Recommendation System** is an intelligent solution designed to help farmers and agricultural stakeholders make informed decisions about which crops to cultivate. By analyzing key factors such as soil properties, weather conditions, and crop requirements, this system provides optimized recommendations for maximizing yield and resource efficiency.

## Features
- **Soil Analysis**: Evaluates soil parameters like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (NPK), pH, etc.
- **Weather Integration**: Considers temperature, rainfall, and humidity for crop suitability.
- **Custom Recommendations**: Suggests the best crops based on user input and data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for easy data input and results display.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS  
- **Backend**: Flask  
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive model using algorithms like Random Forest or Decision Tree  
- **Database**: SQLite / MySQL  

## How It Works
1.Input Data: Users provide soil parameters, weather conditions, and other relevant data.
2.Model Prediction: A machine learning model processes the input data to identify the most suitable crops.
3.Recommendation: The system returns a list of recommended crops with expected suitability.

##cDataset
The system uses a dataset containing soil characteristics, weather data, and crop yield history to train the machine learning model. The dataset can be customized to suit specific regions or farming conditions.

Example Usage
1.Enter the soil NPK values, pH level, and weather details (temperature, rainfall, etc.).
C2.lick on the "Recommend" button.
3.View the recommended crops along with detailed insights.
